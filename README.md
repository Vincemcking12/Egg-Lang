###### a simple programming solution

### Info
>> Egg Lang is a general purpose, functional programming language. It can represent virtually any mathematical function. The language is included as part of the Eloquent JavaScript text book. I took the liberty of remaking the language and adding new features such as try catch blocks and arrays.

### Getting started
> - clone this GitHub repo, if you intend on using it online or as part of your website

> - Download the EggIDE APK from the link below if you intend to use it on your mobile device. download the APK [here](http://example.com "Title").

## Example program.
```
    do(
      var(max, 
           function(n,m,
               if(>(n,m),n,m)
           )
     ),
      print(max(300,500))
   )

```
>> The program above computes the maximum number between two numbers. The value gets printed to the screen, as expected it's result will be as follows: 
```
500
======== Compiler Success =======
```
